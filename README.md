# Code for *M. avium* Population Structure

This repository contains the data and R script used to generate the figures in the manuscript titled "Global Insights into the Population Structure of *Mycobacterium avium* subsp. *hominissuis*"
The code to generate most of the figures in this paper are made available for reproducibility using RStudio v4.2.0

Data to reproduce figures and analysis are in  `data/` directory
## Notes on Figures
- Figure 2 was generated with [Phandango](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/34/2/292/4212949?login=false), hence no R script is provided as the data files can be uploaded into the web server for visualization
- Supplementary Figure 3 is merged with main Figures 3 and 5
- Supplementary Figures 4 and 5 are merged with main Figure 4
