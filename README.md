# MAH_Pop_Structure_paper

The code to generate most of the figures in this paper are made available for reproducibility using RStudio v4.2.0

Data to reproduce figures and analysis are in  `data/` directory

Figure 2 was generated with [Phandango](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/34/2/292/4212949?login=false), hence no R script is provided as the data files can be uploaded into the web server for visualization
